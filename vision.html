    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To give families caring, skilled, and respectful helpers they can rely on.</li>

    <h2>Why "Dignity" for Elderly People</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect for Age and Condition:</strong> Elderly people often face physical, emotional, or cognitive decline. Helping them in a way that preserves their self-respect and doesn't make them feel like a burden is about dignity.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Value Beyond Ability:</strong> Even if an elderly person can no longer walk, speak clearly, or eat independently, they still deserve to be treated with the same worth and grace — this is dignity in action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why "Trust" for Nanny Taking Care of Child</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Dependence:</strong> A child — especially an infant — depends completely on adults for safety, care, and survival. Parents must trust the nanny deeply to leave their child in her hands.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Security:</strong> When a nanny holds a child and the child doesn’t cry or resists, it shows the child feels safe. That’s the purest form of trust — even without words.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why "Comfort" for Workers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We ensure our workers feel safe, respected, and supported in every home they serve. Comfort is essential for their well-being and performance.</li>
    </ul>
